Welcome to my website!

I am a Master's student in the College of Communication at Boston University, studying under the supervision of Drs.  [Maria Betsi Grabe](https://www.bu.edu/com/profile/maria-elizabeth-betsi-grabe/) and [James Cummings](https://www.bu.edu/com/profile/jim-cummings/). Before attending Boston University, I obtained my bachelor's degree at The Chinese University of Hong Kong ‚Äî‚Äî School of Journalism and Communication.

My research focuses on the media effects of AI on user cognition and behavior across digital communication contexts. Most of my work was conducted through experiments and computational methods.
