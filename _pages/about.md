<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

<p>welcome to my website! </p>

<p>I am a Master's student in the College of Communication at Boston University, studying under the supervision of Drs.  [Maria Betsi Grabe](https://www.bu.edu/com/profile/maria-elizabeth-betsi-grabe/) and [James Cummings](https://www.bu.edu/com/profile/jim-cummings/). Before attending Boston University, I obtained my bachelor's degree at The Chinese University of Hong Kong ‚Äî‚Äî School of Journalism and Communication. </p>

<p>My research focuses on the media effects of AI on user cognition and behavior across digital communication contexts. Most of my work was conducted through experiments and computational methods. </p>
